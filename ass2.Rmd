output: 
For the problem, let's assign people the variables. There are 3 groups to be made, with three, four and four people.  
Let A= Alec, B = Chinmay, C= Mercy, D=Rishi, E=Rahul, F=Divya, G=Monalisa , H=Guisen, I=Zi, J=Kyle, K=Shivani
The potential of each candidate when they became a part of any group is sum of the attributes they have provided. And it is same for all 3 groups. 
Let XA1 = Alec working for group 1 
    XA2 = Alec Working for group 2
    XA3 = Alec working for group 3
    XB1 = Chinmay Working for group 1
    .
    .
    .
    XK3 = Shivani Working for group 2
Potential of Alec = 13.4, Chinmay= 10.2, Mercy=8.6, Rishi=13.2, Rahul=18, Divya=16.6, Monalisa=15.4, Guisen=16.8, Zi=12, Kyle=13.4, Shivani=14
